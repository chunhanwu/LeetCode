# LeetCode 38. Count and Say

## 題目

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```
`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.　　

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
## 翻譯

一個算&說出來的序列： 1,11,21,1211,111221
```
1     1個1， 下一個變成 11  
11    2個1， 也就是21  
21    1個2 1個1，得到1211
1211  1個1，1個2，2個1  111221  
```
